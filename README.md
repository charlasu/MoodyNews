Sentiment analysis of the most recent 100 tweets per major news organization.

In an era where the U.S. President's tweets are considered news-worthy and his condemning of the news as "an enemy of the people," it seemed interesting to do a sentiment analysis on the 100 recent (1 Aug 2018) tweets of major North American news organizations. In general, news is rarely positive--since rescuing a cat out of a tree is hardly considered the new of news that the public needs to know about. Yet, here are a few observations:

1) "The Gray Lady" ranks positive with more New York Times tweets above the neutral zone. On the scatter plot, this is detected by number of grey dots and on the bar chart by showing the bar rising. This is followed by CNN.

2) It is a non-native news organization that has the most negative sentiment--BBC North America has the steepest bar heading toward the bottom of the chart.

3) Negative news sells. Looking at the number of dots on the scatter plot above/below the neutral line, you can see a definite weight of dots on the bottom half of the chart. All of this moody news seems to create the malaise of cultural moody blues. Perhaps it's time for a resue from the "Nights in White Satin"?
